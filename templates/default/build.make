; Core version
; ------------
; Each makefile should begin by declaring the core version of Drupal that all
; projects should be compatible with.
  
core = 6.x
  
; API version
; ------------
; Every makefile needs to declare its Drush Make API version. This version of
; drush make uses API version `2`.
  
api = 2
  
; Core project
; ------------
; In order for your makefile to generate a full Drupal site, you must include
; a core project. This is usually Drupal core, but you can also specify
; alternative core projects like Pressflow. Note that makefiles included with
; install profiles *should not* include a core project.
  
; Use Pressflow instead of Drupal core:
projects[pressflow][type] = "core"
projects[pressflow][download][type] = "get"
projects[pressflow][download][url] = "http://files.pressflow.org/pressflow-6-current.tar.gz"

; Install profile
; ---------------
; Check out the install profile from svn
projects[%project%][type]           = "profile"
projects[%project%][download][type] = "svn"
projects[%project%][download][url]  = "%svn-path%/profile"
projects[%project%][download][interactive] = "true"
