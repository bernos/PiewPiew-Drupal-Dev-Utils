Drush command wishlist
----------------------

Create a new project. This command should

- Create a build.make file, containing downloads for drupal core, this drupal 
  dev utility module and the custom install profile for the project. Probably 
  a good idea for this build.make file to contain a lot of examples and 
  comments
  
- Set up an empty installation profile folder, complete with it's own 
  profile.make and profilename.profile php file.
